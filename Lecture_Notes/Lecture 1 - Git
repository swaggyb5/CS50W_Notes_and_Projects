Using Git
Keeps track of changes to code
Synchronizes code between people
Test changes without losing the original
Reverting back to old versions of code

GitHub stores git repositories on the internet

git clone <url> copies a repository from the internet and makes a local copy
Every github repository has a url
git add <filename>  will add a file to the repository the next time it is saved
git commit -m "message" will save a snapshot of the repository and include a message which should describe changes made
git status checks the current status of your repository
git push pushes your repository from your local repository to the github repository
git pull  will download the latest version of the repository on github onto your computer
git log shows a log of all changes made to the repository
git reset resets repository to a previous version
    git reset --hard <commit> returns to the commit number specified
    git reset --hard origin/master returns to the original repository on github



Merge conflicts - when different versions have edited the same code
    code
    <<<<< HEAD
    your_conflicting_code
   ==== 
    their_conflicting_code
    >>>>> something
    rest_of_code
    
    Conflicts are resolved by removing the head and tail and whichever code you wish to remove
