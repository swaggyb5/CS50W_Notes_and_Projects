### Not many notes taken, I was already familiar with the basic Python shown in this course.

Python
Decorators are functions which add functionality to other functions with wrappers
Example:
    def announce(f);
        def wrapper():
            print('About to run the function')
            f()
            print("Done with the function")
        return wrapper

    @announce
    def hello():
        print("Hello, world")
