These are all of my class notes from CS50W - Web Programming with Python and Javascript

I was taking the course in 2020 and they updated the course after I had already watched the first two lectures.
So, the first two lectures, Git and HTML/CSS are the 2018 versions, all lectures afterwards are the 2020 version.

Enjoy.
